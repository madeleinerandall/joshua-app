          <h3>Buying or selling property - Conveyancing</h3>
          <p>
            Whether you are you buying or selling property in NSW, or need
            assistance with a caveat or by-law, Randall & Associates aim to
            provide a fast, efficient, reliable and friendly service.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Randall & Associates we understand that the process of buying and
            selling property is a huge decision, involving a lot of time, money
            and effort. With such a large investment, it can be very stressful
            dealing with the legalities of your sale or purchase. Thatâ€™s why we
            offer a conveyancing service that ensures your property conveyance
            is completed quickly and professionally, so that your transaction is
            as stress free as possible. We will review your contract and guide
            you through the legal process right through to the day of
            settlement.
          </p>

            Why do you need a lawyer/solicitor/conveyancer for your property
            conveyancing?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Whether buying or selling property, you are entering into a legally
            binding contract. Because the contract will be binding between you
            and the other party, it is essential that you understand the terms
            of the agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also essential that all any additional searches are undertaken
            in order to find any defects, caveats or restrictions, etc that
            could be attached to the property. If any defects, caveats or
            restrictions, etc are found on the property's title, they have the
            potential to seriously change or restrict your use and enjoyment of
            the property. We will guide you through the process of either buying
            selling your property.
